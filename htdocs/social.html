                            <p>Social well-being is about maintaining good relationships with others. This is very 
                                difficult nowadays, since we can only interact with others through a screen. We 
                                used to be able to easily talk and interact with friends face-to-face, so how will 
                                we go about this now in this situation? </p>

                        <h1>Why Should We Care?</h1>
                        <p>While it may not seem to be the topmost priority and something that people actively look 
                            after compared to physical and mental health, it is still very important nonetheless. 
                            Being social creatures, it is important to interact with others to avoid being socially 
                            isolated and lonely. We have at least some desire to interact and connect with others. 
                            If we aren't able or allowed to for long periods of time, there may be unwanted and 
                            negative feelings of isolation and further withdrawal. </p>

                        <h1>What Can We Do?</h1>
                        <div class="desc">
                            <p>In all aspects of life we're bound to meet and make connections with people, but
                                nourishing those connections are what matter most, so here are a few things to 
                                keep in mind to maintain good social well-being (specifically during this 
                                pandemic): </p>

                            <ol>
                                <li><span class="list">Try to make new connections:</span> keep making friends 
                                    wherever you go. Who knows, maybe they could be your new best friends! Try to 
                                    interact with your class/schoolmates more, whether for random conversations or 
                                    helping each other out. Even if it's online, it doesn't make it any less 
                                    meaningful! </li>
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Schedule times to hangout or do things together:</span> if 
                                    you're the type to enjoy group study sessions, then this may be right up your 
                                    alley. Schedule some time to review or study with your friends. It could help 
                                    enrich your learnings together. If you prefer to study alone, do not fret! You 
                                    could instead schedule hangouts to just check-in and talk or play fun 
                                    games! </li>
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Keep healthy relationships:</span> not all relationships we 
                                    have are beneficial to us. Healthy relationships rely on trust, respect and 
                                    communication. Having an honest conversation with the person you're facing an 
                                    issue with is crucial in healthy relationships. Now, how they react to this 
                                    conversation (violent reaction or understanding, etc.) would help you assess 
                                    if it is healthy. </li>
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Remember to take care of yourself:</span> as important as 
                                    it is to interact with others, we all need time for ourselves to rest. Remember 
                                    to rest when needed to be able to recharge your social battery. Practicing 
                                    self-care is also important. </li>
