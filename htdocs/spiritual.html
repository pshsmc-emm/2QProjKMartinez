                            <p>Spiritual well-being focuses on having a sense of purpose and reflecting on life 
                                to gain a deeper understanding of it. It's a connection to things that are larger 
                                than our own selves. While most people may automatically think of religion when 
                                it comes to spirituality, this is not the case. Spiritual well-being does not 
                                necessarily equate to religion and religious practices. Its benefits are: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Being content and finding purpose and meaning in life </li>
                                <li>Being able to overcome and grow or cope from challenges </li>

                        <div class="desc">
                            <p>The following are simple things we can do to take care of our spiritual well-being: </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li><span class="list">Do some yoga or meditate:</span> Try this for just a couple of 
                                    minutes a day to have some quiet and clear your mind after a busy day. Additionally, 
                                    doing this increases self-awareness, and helps with concentration. </li>
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Do some praying (to those that practice this):</span> Doing this 
                                    helps connect with a higher being and helps unlock faith. It can also help you find 
                                    some direction when you're feeling lost in the sea of life. </li>
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Write down your thoughts in a journal:</span> This will help you 
                                    reflect and learn more about your actions. It can help you assess your behaviours 
                                    and figure out what things you prioritize in life. </li>                                
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Find your hobbies:</span> Do the things you enjoy doing and 
                                    continue them. Who knows, maybe those hobbies of yours could result into something 
                                    great in the future. It could also give you some sense of purpose and direction on 
                                    what you may want to do if you haven't decided yet. </li>                                    
                                <br />
                                <li><span class="list">Offer to help others:</span> Contribute to a meaningful cause to 
                                    you and help others in need. It helps you get to know your community better and can 
                                    give you some sense of purpose in this world. Face-to-face activities wouldn't be 
                                    the most suitable at this time, but contributing and donating to those that may 
                                    have been affected by typhoons (like Typhoon Odette) or maybe even creating and 
                                    sharing a drive of important resources for others to reference is a big help. It will 
                                    give you a sense of happiness and purpose knowing that your efforts are for others 
                                    and their own good too. It's two birds with one stone! </li>
