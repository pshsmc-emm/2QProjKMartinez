                            <p>Physical well-being, according to the Australian National University, is maintaining 
                                a healthy lifestyle and taking care of our body to avoid negative impacts on our
                                health. Exercise is very important, especially during this pandemic. Let’s take a 
                                look at a simple fitness principle that we can apply to keep ourselves fit and 
                                achieve what goals we want to have in exercising. </p>

                        <h1>F (Frequency)</h1>
                        <p>As the name suggests, it’s how often you plan to exercise. This will be decided by the 
                            type of exercise, how fit you currently are, goals and the next part, intensity. This 
                            will help avoid overworking the body to not lose any of the progress already made. 
                            Here are some of the recommended frequencies for teenagers in different exercises: </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Cardio (raises heart rate): 2-3 times a week</li>
                                <li>Muscle Strength (improves strength of muscles): 3 times a week</li>
                                <li>Bone Strength (helps strengthen bones): 3 times a week</li>
                            </ul>
                    </article>
                    <article class="fitt">
                        <h1>I (Intensity)</h1>
                        <p>This is how vigorous you exercise and how much you have to exert for it. This also helps 
                            avoid straining or overworking the body, which may lead to injuries or soreness. This can 
                            be classified into Beginners (Low Intensity), Intermediate (Mid Intensity) and Advanced 
                            (High Intensity). </p>

                        <h3>How Do We Measure Intensity? </h3>
                        <p>To know that, we first need to know our Maximum Heart Rate or MHR which is measured by subtracting 
                            our current age from the number 220. </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Low Intensity is when our Maximum Heart Rate (MHR) reaches 45-54%. </li>
                            <li>Intermediate or Mid Intensity is when the MHR reachers 55-69%. </li>
                            <li>Advanced or High Intensity is when the MHR is 70% or higher. </li>
                        </ul>

                    <article class="fitt">
                        <h1>T (Time)</h1>
                        <p>This is the duration of time you allot for yourself to exercise. Usually, high intensity 
                            exercises have shorter time than low intensity exercises. Experts recommend teenagers to 
                            have at least 60 minutes of exercise everyday.</p>
                    </article>
                    <article class="fitt">
                        <h1>T (Type)</h1>
                        <p>Type is the exercise that will be performed based on your goals. It could be Cardio, Strength, 
                            Flexibility, and more. Choosing the type you will do depends on what you want to achieve 
                            through exercising (endurance, gain muscle, lose/gain weight). For example, 30 minutes a day of
                            low-to-moderate intensity activities such as dancing, climbing stairs or pleasure walking is good 
                            in order to establish a healthy habit. </p>

                            <p>While the FITT Principle is a guide to regular exercise, the simple things we do 
                                everyday such as chores (sweeping the floor) are actually counted to help keep us 
                                fit! As mentioned above, having good physical well-being is a lifestyle which includes 
                                things more than exercise. Here’s an additional list of simple things one can do to 
                                stay physically fit: </p>
